# Exercise 4: Create and Edit Assessment

Now that we've created a group for our servers we can begin our assessment.  In this exercise we'll create an assessment for the group we previously created and check out the assessment properties that allow us to fine tune the recommendations that Azure Migrate gives us.

> Tips:
 > * This is a new group in a small environment.  In a production environment you can expect to see multiple groups and hundreds of servers.  The filter fields come in handy finding groups and machines to create larger collections of systems that you may want to assess.
 > * Updates to assessment can take a minute or two before it is reflected.  Watch for the notification to know when it is ready.
